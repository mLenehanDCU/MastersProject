With the increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices
in recent years, and the projected growth in the number of connected devices in
the coming years, it is evident that there is a need to investigate the
security flaws which have made these devices a target for Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks. Following the Mirai botnet attack in 2016, it has become
apparent that there is much work required in securing IoT networks. Due to the
relatively low available resources in IoT devices, there is a need to implement
either non-resource intensive security features on the devices themselves, or to
implement more stringent security for these devices at the level of the network.
