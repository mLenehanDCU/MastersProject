The focus of this project will be to evaluate IoT systems in terms of the
devices, networks, and operating systems for their susceptibility to DDoS
attacks. As such, the survey of Salim et al.\cite{Salim2019} provides an
excellent background in the types of attacks, and is a starting point for
assessing the types of solutions which are available to deal with these attacks.
By understanding the types of attacks which commonly occur, more accurate
evaluations can be performed between IoT systems.

IIoT is becoming a large source of data, and accounts for a large number of IoT
devices. The proposal laid out by Yan et al.\cite{iiot_2019} gives an insight
into how security issues within industry are being approached. This type of
system can be investigated as an IoT network as a whole. Simulation of this type
of network is a possible solution for the evaluation of a network consisting of
SDN gateways and multiple controllers.

The suggestions laid out in the work of Yaacoub et al.\cite{iomt_2019}
