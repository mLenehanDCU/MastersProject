It is clear that there is a need to improve the security implementations of
resource constrained IoT devices. From a lack of built-in authentication
management due to low memory availability, to poor protocol implementations
being open to exploit, there is a need for the introduction of a basic set of
standards to which these devices need to adhere.

Better security implementations throughout the area of the Internet of Things
would decrease the available number of devices for use in botnets, and would
decrease the susceptibility of the devices to attack, as the efforts required to
access the devices may now not be worth it.
