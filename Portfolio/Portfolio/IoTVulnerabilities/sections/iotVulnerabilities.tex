Neshenko et al.\cite{neshenko_2019} define 9 classes of IoT vulnerabilities. These are
deficient physical security, insufficient energy harvesting, inadequate
authentication, improper encryption, unnecessary open ports, insufficient access
control, improper patch management capabilities, weak programming practices, and
insufficient audit mechanisms. While a number of these are not relevant to the
susceptibility of these devices to malicious attack for their future use in a
large scale botnet, for example physical security - an attack is not going to
physically connect their PC to thousands of IoT devices to build their botnet -
issues such as improper and encryption authentication methods, open ports, and
an inability to update flaws in firmware certainly leave these devices
vulnerable to attack on a large scale.
