It is clear from the completion of this literature review that there are a
number of proposed solutions for the current issues of security with regards to
IoT devices and DDoS attacks. As the scope of the project is to evaluate IoT
systems at the operating system (OS), network, and device levels for their
susceptibility to attack, the solutions discussed in this review can be used as
a baseline for improving upon.

Further work must be done in order to determine the open source tools which will
be used for the evaluation of these systems. As this literature review deals
solely in the solutions to the security issues in these networks, i.e. the
mitigation and detection techniques used, an assessment must follow into the
available tools for the purposes of evaluation of these networks.
