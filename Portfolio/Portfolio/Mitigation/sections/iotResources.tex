Internet of Things devices are typically low-power devices and sensors. These
devices are network connected, and often interact with a users personal
information. As an affect of the low power resources used on these devices, the
devices critical functions take precedence in terms of memory or processing
performance. This leaves little availability in terms of available resources for
aspects such as security.
