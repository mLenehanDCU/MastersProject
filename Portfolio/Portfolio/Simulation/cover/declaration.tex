I declare that this material, which I now submit for assessment, is entirely my
own work and has not been taken from the work of others, save and to the extent
that such work has been cited and acknowledged within the text of my work. I
understand that plagiarism, collusion, and copying are grave and serious
offences in the university and accept the penalties that would be imposed should
I engage in plagiarism, collusion or copying. I have read and understood the
Assignment Regulations set out in the module documentation. I have identified
and included the source of all facts, ideas, opinions, and viewpoints of others
in the assignment references. Direct quotations from books, journal articles,
internet sources, module text, or any other source whatsoever are acknowledged
and the source cited are identified in the assignment references. This
assignment, or any part of it, has not been previously submitted by me or any
other person for assessment on this or any other course of study.

I have read and understood the DCU Academic Integrity and Plagiarism at

and IEEE referencing guidelines found at
