The desired outcomes of these simulations were achieved. A number of Denial of
Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks were implemented, with an
impact seen on the part of "genuine" user nodes within the network. While the
ICMP and SYN flooding attacks were successfully implemented, mitigation
techniques could only be applied to the Denial of Service simulations. These
simulations demonstrate the difference in attack volume, and differences in the
complexity of defence and mitigation techniques required for a single attacker
versus a distributed network of attackers.
