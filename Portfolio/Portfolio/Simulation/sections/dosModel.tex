For the initial Denial of Service simulation, the network topology is as shown
in Figure \ref{fig:dosNetwork}. This network consists of an attacking traffic
source (shown on the left), a legitimate user traffic source (shown on the
right), and a server (shown on the bottom).

The initial attack type simulated is a Low-Rate TCP attack.
