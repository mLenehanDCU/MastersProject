For work built upon these simulations, the first recommendation is to use either
the Mininet VM image, or a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. While Manjaro is
based on Arch Linux, which has access to a large number of packages, Mininet,
along with a number of the packages used for sending and monitoring traffic flow
were required to be installed from the Arch User Repositories (AUR). For
comparison, Mininet, is available from Ubuntus default "apt" package manager,
along with all of the other software packages used.
