In order to extensively evaluate the impact of Distributed Denial of Service
attacks, and the role which IoT devices play in modern DDoS attacks, simulations
can be used. For the purpose of simulation, the "Mininet" network emulator is
utilised. Mininet utilises the advantages offered by Linux containers. This
allows for many hosts, running Linux kernel code and application code, to
connect over a virtualized network.
