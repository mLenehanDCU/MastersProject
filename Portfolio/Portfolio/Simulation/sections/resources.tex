The following list outlines both the hardware and software resources which were
utilised in the execution of these simulations:

\subsection{Hardware:}

As these simulations utilised Linux containers, only a single PC was required to
execute the simulations. The specifications of the laptop PC are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item HP Envy 17
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Intel Core i7-6500U (Dual Core)
		\item 12GB RAM
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software:}

For these simulations, the Linux operating system was used for it's ease of
installation of software packages, and also for the availability of containers.
Note that a Linux virtual machine would be a suitable replacement.

\subsubsection{Operating System:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Manjaro Linux
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kernel Version 5.4.52-1-MANJARO
		\item OS Type: 64-bit
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulation Software:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mininet
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Version: 2.3.0d6
	\end{itemize}
	\item Floodlight Controller
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Version: 1.2
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
