The proposed approach to this project is to present a detailed technical
evaluation of the security features available at the operating systems
level. These will include features such as networking security - i.e.
firewalls, and software security - i.e. secure boot.

Simulations will be run using ns-3 in order to evaluate the effects of
common DDoS attacks on networks consisting of IoT devices. These simulations
will utilize the available IoT related protocols in ns-3, including IPv6 and
6LoWPAN. The results of these simulations will be evaluated to determine points
of failure within the networks.

Finally, a technical evaluation will be done into the available detection and
mitigation techniques. This will include recommendations of techniques which
could have specific benefits in IoT networks.
