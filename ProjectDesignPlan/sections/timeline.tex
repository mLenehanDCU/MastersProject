The Gannt chart below describes the proposed timeline for the project. All items
within the Gannt chart are colour coded as follows; green represents
documentation - i.e. work on the final report, red represents background
research - i.e. background research required for understanding the topic, blue
represents testing - i.e. simulation testing, orange represents end of week
reviews, during which time the goals of the past week and following week will be
assessed.
